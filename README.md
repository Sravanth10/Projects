Designathon - 
A Nation wide Hackathon conducted by the CSBS branch of VNR VJIET.
It was a 24 hr hackathon .
Topic given was: " **Continuous assessing and feedback in education domain** "
Our proposed Solution was shortlisted among the 500+ teams and we were one of the finalists 
to take part in the Hackathon.

The Repository consists of most of my projects and works in which I have significant 
contributions and I have gained a lot of project-centric knowledge through exploration
and the learning process.
